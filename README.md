# Plug Plates â€“ Supply Chain Mitigation Through Rapid Prototyping

## Overview
This project involved designing and fabricating plug plates for a critical UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) order during a significant supply chain bottleneck. The plug plates, initially delayed due to procurement issues, were urgently required to meet customer delivery deadlines. Leveraging rapid prototyping and 3D printing, we developed functional replacements that closely matched the original specifications, enabling seamless integration into the final assembly line.

## Problem Statement
The original plug plates, sourced externally, were delayed due to global supply chain constraints. This posed a major risk to on-time shipment for a high-profile customer. We needed a fast, reliable, and manufacturable interim solution that could be deployed with confidence in production.

## Objectives
- Create a plug plate prototype that meets dimensional, functional, and fitment requirements.
- Eliminate shipment delays.
- Minimize cost and ensure ease of production with in-house 3D printing.
- Match the form and function of the original component closely enough for field deployment.

## Design & Development Process
1. **Measurement & Modeling**: Reverse-engineered the delayed component using calipers and CAD tools.
2. **Material Selection**: Used durable, production-grade PLA+ filament for prototype iterations.
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: Generated multiple versions to test tolerances and geometrical compatibility.
4. **Fit Testing**: Conducted physical tests to ensure the 3D printed version fit seamlessly into the UPS unit.
5. **Production Deployment**: Final design was greenlit for short-term production use, successfully preventing shipment delays.

## Outcome
- **Delivery Assurance**: Prevented a 3-month delay in shipment for a critical UPS order.
- **Cost Savings**: Eliminated potential expedite fees and downtime losses.
- **Adaptability**: Validated the value of in-house prototyping as a supply chain risk mitigation strategy.
